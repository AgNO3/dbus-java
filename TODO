 * support Enums as UInt32s
 * document debugging
 * document API changes
 * document build and dependencies
 * allow 'virtual' object handlers, so that all object paths under a certain hierarchy are handled by the same object
 * fix dbus-viewer to recurse on paths
 * extend dbus-viewer to make calls
 * check that this is true:
   objects should not return ObjectUnknown if the path has an existant
   child node, but should if not (for introspection) It should return
   UnknownInterface or Method
 * make it work with free VM/Compilers:
   make CFLAGS="`pkg-config --cflags dbus-1` -I/opt/java-generics/include" CLASSPATH=/opt/java-generics/share/classpath/glibj.zip:. LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/java-generics/lib/classpath/ JAVAC="ecj -1.5" JAVA_HOME=/opt/java-generics/ JCFLAGS="-cp classes -bootclasspath /opt/java-generics/share/classpath/glibj.zip" JAVA=jamvm  check
   after installing eclipse eclipse-ecj jamvm and compiling classpath-generics with prefix=/opt/java-generics
   Current failure with 0.92:java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: unimplemented interface on AnnotatedElement.getAnnotations().
   http://builder.classpath.org/japi/jdk15-generics.html suggests that this is fixed in HEAD
