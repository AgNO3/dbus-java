D-Bus Java Bindings README
--------------------------

Compilation and installation is described in the INSTALL file.

This will install a shared object file, two jar files, three binaries and some
documentation in the form of an HTML/PDF guide to writing D-Bus Java programs,
JavaDoc API for the bindings and man pages for the supplied programs. Read the
documentation, it's there for a reason.

The installed programs are documented in their respective man pages.

CreateInterface is a tool for creating interface stubs for D-Bus programs.  It
will connect to services running on the bus and introspect on them to find
their API. This will then be written as Java interface definitions suitable for
importing into your program. A file containing the introspection data can be
used instead.

ListDBus lists the names currently connected to a bus.

DBusViewer is a graphical tool which combines the two tools. It will list the
names on a bus and allow you to introspect on them and save the result as Java
interface files. This currently only introspects on the root object, however.

To run a Java program using D-Bus you need to have the libdbus-java jar file in
your classpath and both the libdbus and libdbus-java shared object files in
your library path. With the default install paths you may have to do something
like:

java -cp /usr/local/share/java/dbus.jar -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib/jni

You may also have to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib/jni
